# PrecisionMedicineToolkit

# Introduction
Electronic medical database information needs to be easily accesible and translatable between scientists. Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data should follow specific file formats so they can be analyzed with ease. Collaboration between clinical and bioinformatics work is currently difficult as data exchange formats for EMRs are very different.  

# What is this
This is pipeline that uses a set of tools to perform analysis on input electronic medical database data. This toolkit takes an input EMR JSON that will search databases to extract relevant information. A FHIR-compliant JSON will be created from the input EMR file.
